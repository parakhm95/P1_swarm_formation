## Explanation

``swarm_original`` is the code that showcases the methods shown in the video. 

``swarm_condensed`` is the code that showcases a more compact form with highlights of boxes around the robots to mark their location. It uses laplacian matrix to represent the graph of the robots that connects them for the formation-making process.
